# Tetris-game-c-
This is the basic implementation of tertis game. The falling pieces randomly from the sides are bombs which have functionality to clear the whole grid if it touches ablock with same colour.
The bombs are not fully functional, so it might make some issues while playing the game, so you can comment it or  feel free to improve the code.
